# Python Standard Library

The Python online documentation has an [excellent page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) describing the standard library, which a large set of standard functionalities that come with any full Python distribution. These functionalities include built-in [functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html), [constants](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html), and [object types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html), and [data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html).

We recommend that you read these sections in the Python documentation. In {numref}`ExerStandardLibrary` below, you will read through the ACME open access lab on the standard library, which covers these topics. And you will complete five problems from that lab in the exercise.

## Other exercises

1. Determine which of Python's built in objects (string, dict, list, tuple, set, int) are mutable and which are immutable.
2. Create a python module that prints something (e.g. `Hello World!`) and run it from the command line using `python module_name.py`.
3. Create a python notebook and run it in VS Code
4. Write a function that finds the Fibonacci sequence up to an integer `N` > 0 in the notebook.  Now call this function for `N = 10` and `N=100`.
5. Use the `sys` module to create a relative path from a Python module, print that path.
