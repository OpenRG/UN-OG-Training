# Introduction to Python

The `OG-Core` model, as well as the country-specific calibration packages, are written in the Python programming language.  These training materials will provide you with sufficient background with Python and some of its most-used packages for data science that you will be able to understand and contribute to the source code underlying `OG-Core` and the calibration packages. We assume some basic background with mathematics, economics, and programming, but we do not assume any prior knowledge of Python.

As we walk you through the basics of Python, we will leverage some excellent open source materials put together by [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) and the [Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis at BYU](https://acme.byu.edu/).  And while we will point you to their tutorials, we've customized all our excercises to be relevant to the `OG-Core` model and the calibration packages.

# Overview on Python
Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) programming language... it's an interpreted language... it's a general purpose programming language... it's an open source language....

Python has some built in functionality with the standard library, but most of the functionality comes from packages that are developed by the open source community.  The most important packages for data science are: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  We will introduce each of these packages as we go through the training materials as they are used heavily in `OG-Core` and the calibration packages.
