# Python Standard Library

The Python online documentation has an [excellent page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) describing the standard library, which a large set of standard functionalities that come with any full Python distribution. These functionalities include built-in [functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html), [constants](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html), and [object types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html), and [data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html). We recommend that you read these sections in the Python documentation. In {numref}`ExerStandardLibrary` below, you will read through the ACME open access lab on the [standard library](https://acme.byu.edu/0000017c-ccff-da17-a5fd-cdff02690000/acmefiles-08-standardlibrary-2021-pdf), which covers these topics. And you will complete five problems from that lab in the exercise.
